    <h1>African Amricans In WWII</h1>
      <h2>Thesis</h2> 
      <p>African Americans that fought in WWII faced racism and were told that they could never fight better than the all White troops but some all African American troops did better than all white troops. These men not only faced racism at home but the racism continued throughout the war from there white associates and enemies they also faced abuse from the generals and other white army men. African Americans fought in the war and proved themselves to people who didn’t believe in them and that they were wrong, and that they should be treated equally this helped achieved equal rights.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p> 
Even through racism in WWII African Americans still were very successful. Before the U.S joined the war on December 7, 1941, African Americans particularly in the South were treated awfully and had to deal with racism and segregation just because they had a different skin color. In 1941, only 4,000 troops in the military were African Americans and in 1940 President Franklin Delano Roosevelt turned down demands for the military to become desegregated, which meant not many African Americans could join the military. In the beginning of the war, African Americans only served as non-combatants but as the war progressed African Americans were assigned to all black units and were support troops. Their role in the military was, at home working in factories to produce weapons for the war but also as soldiers some notable units were the 332nd fighter group also known as The “Tuskegee Airmen” and the “369th infantry unit” known more as “The Harlem Hellfighters”. It was a double war for African Americans between racism at home and the war across the world which made the “Double V Campaign” wanting for a victory in the war and against segregation and racism, so the war gave a lot of opportunities. Even through the high enlistment rates not many African Americans were drafted and sent to war including African American women who served as nurses. It was extremely important to be accepted into the military because it would meen taking a step to achieving equal rights in the United States.

      <h2>Build-Up</h2> 
      <p> 
        Fighting for the right to fight was a big accomplishment in WWII for African Americans because it brought the ideal of equality in the military. After WWI, African Americans thought the U.S would change and ban segregation in the military but it stayed the same and African Americans were still viewed as second-class citizens. When the U.S joined WWII, the government refused to let African Americans serve because some units in WWI didn’t perform well because they were poorly trained.
      </p>

 <p> 
      On, June 25th, 1941, Executive Order 8802 was put into place to ban racial discrimination and segregation in the draft which is where people are drafted to fill open spots because of casualties in the military, but after the draft during training and in the war it could be segregated. The military was reluctant at first, but eventually one million African Americans served in the military. African Americans were welcome in the defense industry but during the war the Ku Klux Klan would beat African American soldiers and there would be racial clashes between black and white citizens. By being allowed to fight in the military, while it was still segregated, African Americans were gaining some rights to achieving equality in the military and eventually the country. 
      </p> 

        <p>
        The Tuskegee Airmen played a huge role in showing that African Americans could fight just as well as white soldiers. The Tuskegee Airmen flew P-51 Mustangs and were some of the best fighter pilots in the whole war, in fact, they had 200 missions in a row without losing a single fighter or bomber, which was the best record in the whole war which no one will ever beat. They were so good that even some white soldiers would complement them, although they were really good at what they did they still faced a lot of racism they faced people who said rude and hateful comments and actions, they did not get the awards and ranks that they deserved they were always thought of less superior. These men were stationed in Tuskegee Alabama and would win 850 medals there were around 500 different airmen. After the war ended the Tuskegee airmen were put into an experiment, this experiment was where some of the Tuskegee Airmen had a disease that there was a cure for but the government wouldn’t give the cure to the airmen. The government would kill innocent people for the name of science so that they could see how the disease would affect the human body. These were the Tuskegee airmen and the Tuskegee experiment.
