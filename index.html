    <h1>African Amricans In WWII</h1>
      <h2>Thesis</h2> 
      <p>African Americans that fought in WWII faced racism and were told that they could never fight better than the all White troops but some all African American troops did better than all white troops. These men not only faced racism at home but the racism continued throughout the war from there white associates and enemies they also faced abuse from the generals and other white army men. African Americans fought in the war and proved themselves to people who didn’t believe in them and that they were wrong, and that they should be treated equally this helped achieved equal rights.</p>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p> 
Even through racism in WWII African Americans still were very successful. Before the U.S joined the war on December 7, 1941, African Americans particularly in the South were treated awfully and had to deal with racism and segregation just because they had a different skin color. In 1941, only 4,000 troops in the military were African Americans and in 1940 President Franklin Delano Roosevelt turned down demands for the military to become desegregated, which meant not many African Americans could join the military. In the beginning of the war, African Americans only served as non-combatants but as the war progressed African Americans were assigned to all black units and were support troops. Their role in the military was, at home working in factories to produce weapons for the war but also as soldiers some notable units were the 332nd fighter group also known as The “Tuskegee Airmen” and the “369th infantry unit” known more as “The Harlem Hellfighters”. It was a double war for African Americans between racism at home and the war across the world which made the “Double V Campaign” wanting for a victory in the war and against segregation and racism, so the war gave a lot of opportunities. Even through the high enlistment rates not many African Americans were drafted and sent to war including African American women who served as nurses. It was extremely important to be accepted into the military because it would meen taking a step to achieving equal rights in the United States.
